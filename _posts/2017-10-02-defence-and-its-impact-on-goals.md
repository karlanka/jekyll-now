title: The impact of defending on scoring goals
---
## Intro
In this post I will try to show the impact defenders have on the chance of a goal being scored. While I was almost done writing the code [@EightyFivePoints](https://twitter.com/EightyFivePoint) posted [something](http://eightyfivepoints.blogspot.co.uk/2017/09/bodies-on-line-quantifying-how.html) that was very similar to what I was doing. This was a little bit disappointing while at the same time it proved that my approach was not that stupid.

### Code
For those interested I have published the repo with the code for this post on my [github-profile](https://github.com/karlanka/). Most of the code live inside this [Notebook](https://github.com/karlanka)
